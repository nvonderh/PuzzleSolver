 Grid Based Puzzle Solver for Sudoku-like Games

Backend logic for Sudoku appears to be done. It has passed the Easy, Medium, and Hard puzzles from the New York Times app two days in a row. Will try to update as/if needed.

Next Puzzle to be worked on is going to be Ken Ken.

Front End work is the current priority as it is only hard coded and doesn't really do anything right now.
